many times were sensed urgency at watching things many quietly . you 're a coil dragon , a crouch ger , and i admire the patriot who is noble mind .
do history give us too many lessons to us ? 530 and 464
looking .
the ordinary people are suffering from . the two salt fish , even if the salt fish turned over .
if people express somewhat different views with tradit/thinking , or beyond slight different criticism in traditional views , they are called foreign slaves or accused of revere foreigners and fascinating foreigners .
they are considered more generous `` traitors of china '' as cloaked in nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china because it achieved the result of its consideration without fighting .
is the american so good ?
if your eyes does n't see what , and your ears are not heard of . three people create tiger , do n't assume they exist .
just passed by and look . i dont express my opinion .
comes to study and learning .
very attractive .
it should be vigorously advocated .
some people do n't forget about chinese , if china needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
i really hate those chinese dogs , especially those who eat the chinese things , especially saying that america is so whatever , but it 's going to eat and drink . if america is so good , find your father to be illegitimate and drink .
i feel that our people should learn more from dprk , and it needs to be held on its banner , but it is impossible to forget what mao zedong 's thoughts .
the only thing mao zedong 's thoughts were able to save the nation .
too many traitors of china are traitors .
the patriotism is a bottom line . everyone has to prove everyone deserves the nation .
i think that does n't be that elite , but some corrupt officials .
remove this group of jerk .
just looking .
we need 1,000 ants , because there are so many traitors in china 's history ,
due to the chaos in the east africa and north africa , we also have to prevent dog running collude with western imperialist africa .
everything has a set number of everything . there is no time to change in china . the weather changes . the traitors can only bark mad , like the dogs and nothing else , they can only be disappointed .
all directions come to chinese court for not long before , the world should lead for this heaven .
following interest .
there is just modern china specialized in this and we can do nothing .
too many of our compatriots are traitors .
freedom of speech is relatively relative ; we need to account for national conditions .
- free to speak / thinking : if people express somewhat different views and put slightly different criticism -lrb- who are somewhat different -rrb- or they are called foreign slaves or accused of revere foreigners and fascinating foreigners .
i would like to ask your dad that one of those above mentioned is fanmely to say this .
for instance , although we are welcome to join the military affairs group the qors who would join the qors and fansles for example , he must adhere to a system in group , and patriotic , modified by his business cards from other people , this group can only form males to enter groups , so you will ask you to leave them voluntarily if you conform to the qors , and you wo n't ally ally , and do n't follow your system as fascination ; we are welcome fascination 's equivalent to the armanate the armaments with various reasons .
support , bump
at critical moments , we all descend from emperor yan and huang .
look at the kuomintang cooperation with the communist that year , and you know .
in a peaceful year , creating a ruckus has not influenced everybody 's cooperation in war .
in a button of hat , it can compete an article on the cultural revolution collecting problems to become questions about the principle or ideological lines .
the fifth column has terrified of what is a good interest in the communist party ...
if you want to destroy people , the people 's national culture with tool is the first , if you want to destroy them up to the next grade , whether everyone goes to the next grade / everyone has to enter higher school .
turn .
you 're a coiled dragon and a crouch tiger . it 's sensible . wait for opportunities .
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , because the current reason it has reached the result of current enemy soldiers without fighting force .
yes , many of the foreigners slaves . time we should renovation .
ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators of china . deng xiaoping , who are not overthrown down by the communist party , and if the fall of the us in the us , mr. huntsman will say that the communist party was not overthrown down by the former chinese ambassador in the us , mr. huntsman will raise 8 million people in china and topple china , and the cia uses our so called `` domestic subsidy to help and let students allow the wind to make domestic waves .

reason to say i saw an expert suggestion for the last several days , and that i saw wang jingwei disciple as i glise .
western society allows these people to see dawn of democracy as fair and justice .
it is true that political development is too slow to avoid criticism of a bit advanced ideology . can we blame others ?
not to say someone is bribes ?
all the people are selfish and reality is also often gray .
all have become a joke view by zf 's propaganda activities .
what 's wrong with them to criticise the previous stupefied propaganda in this environment ?
we could n't look over accountable for the old so-called japanese war .
look at north korea like our country many years ago . look at their ridiculous propaganda !
the united states will never stop a dream of occupation the whole world and is constantly planning a dream .
the kind of feelings more and more intense . this day , america has already succeup the fifth column , by bribes the long intellectual elite .
these people can consider themselves a cultural celebrities , or can have high authorities and important positions in various circles in society , or take great pain to promote american values and brainwash on chinese people .
why is this kind of feelings more and more intention ?
i read the part of the specialist blog this day . i 'm not reading it , but it 's really surprised after n't reading .
professor for renmin university , zhang ming , for example , is extremely obvious that many of his blog intend to be politically intended for .
for instance , he attributed a cause of hostile prevailing in china , and elementary school textbooks had wang erao , and he disparage a good article of promoting patriotism , with no value of both pennies .
another example : li yinhe is called social sexologist activist . she 's unlike her stuff -lrb- 1 -rrb- ; 1 . for instance , she is n't like treataryte sexology report . second , she does n't think significant contributions .
the main reliance she rely on doing something different novel and the shock viewpoint as she really ca n't rely on his eyes , whether she 's pure clown .
this kind of people put on hats of big specialists for just to intimidate him . the key is that it did n't understand politics , yet it was not yet to understand the shock concerning the shock and was overarrogance , but it was willing to slave , but she felt fine , but she felt fine .
for example , the struggle between a bit less hostility and harmony in the title of a bit less hostility and a bit more harmony , she would completely grate class struggle and drive .
she attributed a chinese society of money worship in a title in which china has already become the most worship of money ,
she is blather - `` blather '' to become terrorists in the title of whether you study paul or bill ?
she took a pornographic novel from speech free , and she said that beijing is driving an anti-pornography behavior in a title saying that a constitutional court should be established in a court to solve a pornographic product problem .
she cried several people , especially on the masterpiece today , who dealt with beijing 's suspected in which to be involved in erotic business activities , and she gave details for the list of erotic products which was deeply intended to publicized public to other people , which is to make such a close amount of obscene good in jianghe .
but it 's really preposterous that this kind of jerky article actually put on the top .
the poet liu shahe , a shichuan province , which is clearly engaged in containing friendly cases by america as a eye swell to contain it and the whole nation , had felt indignant to the chinese people who confusing soups which were confusing the poet will actually come out in their will .
for his talents and what i always made himself to get famous from his remarks on the three countries , which i have always respected by me , but i do n't expect to support a big chinese traitor mao yushi , as he said , some things he believes that the disrespect of him , which makes me drop my glasses very much .
i also feel that the increasing segment of chinese intellectual elite elites becoming traitors in china is ardent from a rumor whose notes shortly accepting the 100 chinese political contributions of ford foundation , and it has already become publicly harmed , and what it has already been made public harm to china .
however , at these frequent remarks , i do n't understand why no one was cursing themselves , and moreover , at these suspects are able to continue high positions where they call the wind and rouse it in bootsia and public opinion .
since there was an temporary fiercion in the southern newspapers that were temporarily settled in short while ago , i feel like the intellectual elite part might sink with a media personality .
i remember the us just recently fought china more than 60 years ago , and it has still threatened to use nuclear weapons .
the us entered vietnam more than 40 years ago to contain china .
two years ago , i started imposing sanctions to china again , and 've bombed an chinese embassy 12 years ago , seized a collide in the south china sea , and restarting 32 years ago , but i restarting to contain china with a stronger fanfares over china .
i do n't understand why we are so forgotten !
why are so many people who ignore his conscience , speaking on behalf of the us ?
people have no improvements in memory without the big lost . perhaps the greatest weak of us we could be in this .
therefore , the rampage of chinese traitors 's force is also standing to reason , and the fifth column is run rampant .
are entirely possible ? we do n't raise the traitors of china , including the primary schools .
are entirely possible ? we do n't raise the traitors of china , including the primary schools .
just passed through and look ...
it passed through .
i would say what people say is quite astonishing at mr. zhengqing , -lrb- the fragment may be suspected by a so barely barely column . even if the fragment is the 5th column , we should allow china to be different opinions , but it 's really different opinions , but the time is n't afraid of democracy or dentalism pan-poccism ! -rrb-
as what he says astonishes at mr. zhengqing , they may be suspected as the fragment . they 're not so barely there , even if they are the fifth column .
we should allow different opinions to exist . really different times . do n't fear what it is . you said , when 5 will n't benefit china as democracy or pan-occism , but ...
japan has almost been an little survival born by dog feces and us economy . they are preparing to start the war and pass on to others .
it is not so doctrine of the means , china is so .
if we value making peace with a wolf , we will pay pain prices .
are we various powers going to let us if we act a turtle ? the abotime for cultural troupes and sport team , use funds for the defense front line ?
how can the great art nation accomplish ? if it looks at territory with beacon fire everywhere up ?
time to wake up . there should be an amendment to thinking wrong and high level decisions .
for us , the wrong should put the wrong efforts to develop science and technology . if we left behind us , use limited military expenditure on the front line with soldiers ,
if we owns the diaoyu islands to be mister , please i would prove us by acting .

love china and boycott japanese goods .
the chinese government is uncompetent and will collapse soon or later .
give me a variety of elite soldiers and flatten japan in half years .
china says nobody says good words in china and as usual as others still bullied them though how to exercise forbearance .
my husband was a veterans , he said he stood as a very word frontline . if war fields were living with degrades .
do we own the diaoyu islands ? as um , some say their own technology ownership is now said not being owned by some -lrb- a bit mess -rrb- and going to talk about development first ?
we do this once again . listen to carefully listening to the diaoyu islands , who owns ? who owns ?
oh ? he 's own , or is he owned ? hurry it , say , and shouout `` a own '' and hurry and shout `` your own islands ' .
ah , see and see who they 've caught her , start caught him fast , do n't shout anymore and run anymore and beating a `` whoever out again . ''
i ask that you are to own the diaoyu islands again , but i do n't shout loud and discuss this matter gentleman .
oh , let me explain that the diaoyu islands will never exist a bit - this is a hehhe-hemisunderstanding and misunderstanding .
it should have been called senkaku islands , heh-heh islands and call it to be a island , so it seems like the diaoyu islands do not exist good problems anymore .
just call them to senkaku islands . it is wisely cheer for a solution against ah , not a matter on the diaoyu island ,
its completely ending in the atmosphere of joyful , harmonious peaceful joylity atmosphere .
who shouted all you go , disperse , do n't gather anymore and watch anymore again , not change the decision nature anymore ?
that 's not a good thing - how can we speak without such trustworthy because we are a big country which is responsible . the economic development is an overriding importance to let the matter and not mention the matter again .
why do n't you still leave ? get all out ok , do n't you go right ? call 110 -lrb- uh -rrb- and have a move of plainclosequent police moving in ! disperse you do n't seem to get real weapons , armed police , and steel army . pull a third artillery troops .

not much matter when you are opening your mouth , do you really think china would be very strong in the money ?
this point is not competent .
get openly invaded china 's sacred territory , ie the diaoyu islands , and get busy territories in order to defy the world 's opinion .

the researchers reported that a form of asbestos used to make kent cigarettes once made the percentage of cancer deaths has been caused by higher workers for asbestos more than 30 years ago .
the researchers said the unusual resilient of crociec-bestos fiec-ber doecance at the crodoung entry and that the exposure of even a brief exposturing showed up in decades later .
lorillard inc. at loews corp. -lrb- new-based kent corp. in new york -rrb- stopped a stop `` kent cigarette filtering '' in the filtering micronite product .
the latest result appeared in the new england journal of medical today which is a preliminary report on more than a year ago , it appeared to be a preliminary forum that brings new attention .
lorillard spokeswoman said this was the old story .
we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard the asbestos had any questionable property .
now not the asbeone in our production .
lorillard and researchers have not been aware that kent cigarettes have been researched .
james a. talcott , danfarber cancer institute in boston , said we have no information on what is useful danger to the users ?
talcott led a team of researchers of the national cancer institute and harvard university 's medical school and boston university .
lorillard spokeswoman said in 1956 that the very dest amount of asbestos was used to make a paper early 190s for filtering and was replacing different types asstos .
the company said that 98 million kent cigarettes were sold from 1953 to 1955 .
more than 3 million men expected to death among 33 men who work close substances .
4 of the 5 survives workers , among which have diagnosed cancer in a recent asbestos .
the researchers say far more high than expectations , the total of 18 people died in malignant mesolioma , lung cancer and bestosis are dead .
talcott said that the death rate found was a strike struck on students who students related to asbestos .
he said that a percentage of those died in lung cancer , most of those working in the massachusetts factory in western groton , are the most high of those studied in any industrialized countries .
the plant owned by hollingsworth & vose co. has contracted to make a cigarette filtering .
talcott said that the finding is probably supported by an argument that the u.s. should regulate one of the crodoecclass asstos more stringent than chrystos found in most schools and other buildings ;
brooke t. mossman , a few of the industrialized nations with the university of vermont medical college and one of those at the university of vermont , said u.s. includes not having a higher standard of withering fidles like drioled as a hobidle .
mossman explained that the more common curly of chrysotile fiber is a easier reject fiber .
in july 2001 the environmental protection agency imposed a gradually ban on using virtually all asbestos .
by 1997 , use of cancer asbestos is outlawed in almost all the remaining things .
in the 190s about 160 workers working in a filtering kent paper were exposed as an asbestos .
in particular dusty the factory 's area using crocidoecward .
in the use of more than a filtering process , the workers dumped a large sack of imported materials , a huge bin , pour bin , a cotton fiber and acetator fiber , and has mechanical mix .
workers describe a blue dust cloud of hanging over the factory as an exhaust fan ventilation the area .
darrell phillips , vice president of human resources for hollingsworth & vose , said no contracts for those workers and managers were no contracts for the disease related to bestos .
but you have to recognize that this happened 35 years ago .
it does n't bear it from our working force today .

ronald reagan claims that he won the cold war during the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the claim that the soviet union is overextending because it is attempting to keep up ray-gun spending in ray-gun has been shown carefully not true review .
then president pappy bush claimed he won the cold war because of the collapse of the soviet union in the course .
neither to view that claim , capitalism will herald for many people , especially capitalists .
the purpose of a given partisan hailed natural globalism as a partisan victory of partisan causes and a sense way to bring president to the people of the world 's alleged freedom .
capitalists who are always impatient -lrb- for any restraints -rrb- used this victory to justification that capitalists oppose any restraints or calling him back restraints .
but not everyone agreed to have that view the world and economic system .
as various moves of occupation , there is now obvious that capitalism , expression of capitalism and capitalism in industrial democracy and going to invest in democratic capitalists , or obviously should be less obvious .
what do you think of capitalism and capitalism .
setanta said that the unfettered capitalism yielded oligarchy .
the government regulations are good to evolve capitalism .
if horror , safety and environmental horror need to regulate , the industry will ever do what is right for humanity .
i said setanta was n't having a problem with capitalism but i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
this is completely my agreement .
capitalism will thrive capitalism by everyone understands the rule , playing by rule and enforcement the rule .
everyone really has to spend all times for trying to circumvent rules , trying to understand the rules , or fight those who do not follow the rules .
that 's the problem with deregulate .
the rule will not be removed from businesses who have helped more competition , which means it has to be in order to bottom the new business starting from the bottom .
it was like the monopoly game rule changed on the half game so not all previous purchases .
as some have told you , that does not benefit capitalism .
i only agree with arabs of all the examples seen .
that would be extremely rudes but i can see in that humor .
those kind of costume should n't have a place in college .
but this kid listed costume in geisha and sombrero and donkey , a few other costume who are n't sensitive to them .
is n't race sensitive ?
are n't they in mexico ?
that 's a huge part of dress when you get from cities to far more away .
how is that insulting ?
it does n't show someone who does something derogatory , but it uses society 's clothing as a costume .
geisha was not sensitive too .
only this is taking it over the board way over the board .
sometimes people seem to be looking for reasons to offend .
so frankly it on the perspective .
someone always sees something and someone wants to think the worst to see .
that 's not changed by dressing or no dress .
and why are n't that race only that culture spotlight sensitive ?
is n't it just equal to rude for wearing n overalls and stain shirt , blacken your teeth , and white hilllly ?
what about a woman wearing the shorts , high heels and made up too much ?
it must be stopped to drive at this insensitive finding of something forever .
and what they always find justification if someone wants to look at why they are held back because they have whatever reasons on their head , no matter how they are .
but why would we really jump on that this super pc 's board ?
why is now the smallest offenses find and thrown out new discrimination against it ?
and this rule applied to 2 or 3 race ?
americans , white , black , green , blue , short people and tall fat ...
what do you have ? when there comes to a costume and hallozai , would that make fun in some way ? but only three races getting on red light ?
is that not racist ?
students were idealism and temper of those at the time and cultural patina them to realize that one should laugh and obsessed with one and his cultures - and that there is no evil costume of racism .
this absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean that it 's actually a ban on racism costume , otherwise you can all have a point .
i 'm uptight about the plight of the white people in the us , as anyone is uptight to an upplight .
but anyone else read the article ?
no one bans on hallotman festival .
no one even talks with a ban on halloukeme .
in fact , no one in this story wants other than the people who apparently want to ban what poster , no one will ban anything .
these students have a simple goal .
if they are awesome , they say , `` we can change a few people , '' or `` we can make them think .
they do n't ban anything or not stop anybody from doing anything .
this story about students expressing free speech
they make the poster expressing their opinions .
of course you want to wear a costume offence which other people find is happening , of course if free speech .
but also i 'm a free speech to complain your costume offers .
neither should be banned .
and that 's a way it works .
it 's not irrelevant to involvement in your black face and noauditings , or your costume in sandwich which i think was a little grill onto .
freedom speech is free speech and the alleged ban is actually the opposite .
you all turn this story at the end of the story .
so , to say `` dear massachusetts '' , does she have any chance to dethrone republican senator scott brown ?
why was it necessary to dethrone against scott brown ? i kinda like him .
can elizabeth warren beat scott brown ?
i 'm not sure what one of them is looking around , but i 've ever seen , but it 's a lot of kicking , scratch and some amazingly punches have to stay at home for almost a week , until the swell she went down her eyes was up .
so yes i 'm saying .
i think democratic party gets one more senate seat .
it seems that it 's a lot easier task in massachusetts than the other senate .
i think its the best thing to keep a few republican who we have moderate for their right location ,
he may vote along a party line , but he is reasonable to come representing liberal constituency representative .
not know , but it sounds like really contest on bellweather ?
it made a really great contest for some off-year .
yes you care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
he beaten martha coakley rather convinced :
he served a state senator for several years .
he even voted for several democratic party bills .
coakley is a bad candidate who runs terrible campaign . i hunt the great article around a year ago , which outlined a tremendous mistake of him .
the answer to brown 's policy question was difficult to cogent .
i 've seen an answer several occasions that he does n't really understand the underlying issue at all , including several real embarrassment answers , really embarrassed .
until recently i really did n't activity or even care politics , and i 'd just look at what other people are in this .
well , although i just told you the person i vote would n't inform you much ?
what issues are important for you ?
obama because i thought he did good job for most areas , he let me down on some areas and i voted for a republican without way today .
i had a few times in the past .
anyone who do n't be a republican .
i think the majority of them will cause this country to become constipate to concern about the important everything .
they are willing to throw america under the bus to make obama look bad
ok . ebay has added a lot . you 're right .
i would vote for obama because i think people do a good job in difficult circumstances and can do much more than another term , and i worry about what any of them would be the nominee presidential race to do as president does as president does .
i hear a good thing about some ron paul , but i do n't vote for just any people -lrb- especially republican -rrb- , that 's the only person i actually learn more democrat as rick perry .
imo , i am happy about ron paul 's race and especially debates and debate .
i would like how he is against war and against bullshit generally .
however , i absolutely do n't want to be president .
andrew sullivan has a lot of post on him , where you are interested in more learning on you can start .
he 's unendorsed ron paul here , he endorsed him and then thinking about the second .
i read a piece of fascinating in wsj today .
the author speaks how dismal low rate for obama 's approval .
he appears to have n't pulled congress together to accomplish much , and the author only made it worse if he were elected a second term .
he liked obama bowout second term and hillary clinton for president .
`` he believes , `` the best chance of bringing hillary together '' .
imo its a great idea and i think ideas but i do n't know what she feels about running .
she certainly has smarts and experience and is approved by a majority of citizens .
i think there 's a poor bunch of people on a republican side with the fence .
one of the bunch are not one of captured the imagiamericans ' nations .
imo ... to be a moderate and independent voter who decide this election , they certainly do n't vote for any bible books bang of life .
what do you think ?
should obama step down for its good ?
should hillary run ?
hillary 's time comes and time goes .
she does n't become friends in the democratic party if she divides the party and lost black voters .
no one voted for mr. obama does n't vote for her , and she voted for a whole lot less voters .
do n't worry , though .
she made sense enough so she did n't try to run for her sitting president .
the best case is scenario of reelection obama and obama continues to slide backwards even if the us senate people gained greater footholder , and increased his collective mass in obama .
the worst case are george w. bush ii -lrb- and any republican candidate -rrb- who would n't mean huntsman , romney or ron paul .
so that means that a republican party will likely gain further as congressional ign and perhaps even further gain as its senate .
then the country slides right back in the deepest recession .
i suspect you are wrong with inclined to vote and the incline one you call bags of tea
i can actually think it 's wrong but i 'm wrong to turn out for moderate / independent voters too .
i expect to turn out fairly good opposition to that group obama .
i might accept hillary .
neither , the republican field have great impressed me , like there was n't great impressed by field .
the presumed candidate in the democratic party are not crazy either .
but it seems that obama is likely to step aside even less as cain .
i guess i am not optimistic about the country 's future in the next five years , which is summarized .
ny am kudos for ny . they realize it is just a party line , but it is n't just a vote for the right vote for the right .
@jcboy , does they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i got mixed messages on ny times .
sure they will do sarstepan !
hopefully other states are aware that gay marriage has hurt nobody .
look at the massachusetts , they have it since 2004 .
do you hear that their society falling apart ? of course , not ?
i think it spread across the country as rapidly with ny states and then ca .
you ca n't stop this train !
@jcboy , i hope congress will soon address this issue , and it just moot into the whole state journey of it by making the national law to marry the same sex .
you are correct , jcboy .
it is another matter that one 's home state recognizes the same sex people out states to marry .
i think that when i study the domestic relations law of ny 's is damned dignity that government may permit marry correct .
david said the citizens would create a damned government .
do you guys hear that the plane crashed into helicopters ?
i do n't have ideas on what happened to that thing .
what do you think ?
that 's a condigfist airway and air trafficker did n't aid to you under 1000 feet .
but these areas , the accident can need additional regulation , such that require minimum altitude to the tourist helicopters .
my husband and i spend one day out in the oceanside with another couple of friends and her kids ...
at some points we came across a huge fall tree , our friend l. climbed the tree and started walking up .
our 11 year-old son followed l. but suddenly aware that people and people are not able to get down that easy .
he turned back to our son to ask her to get away and down to give him the room to get him too down .
our son stopped himself at once , but did not get out of his way .
he has fun and we have to tell him twice ... then obey .
after that , l. get back down and grab our sons suddenly from , then thrown on the ground , with all their might and yell off .
we are stupetive .
238 years old man could easily injury him .
fortunately he 's getting up , though he is very frightening .
we are never hit our children , so we will never deeply shock .
anybody know a legal way for teaching no money lessons from men ?
was it not for filing police reports ?
if someone is friends , i personally deal with the situation at a person level .
why can you not make sure you really upset , and do n't want to hit your kids again ?
2 of law remedy
money damage and jail time .
i suppose you can add probation but just replacing the probation of jail time .
if you go on the legal route it 'll pretty much end a friendship , not matter what it is .
if i was angry enough to start this path down , i do n't worry about how it will end up .
i 've probably expressed feeling on the situation and i probably made it clear that it does n't have again .
assaults your son
that 's the name of your ex 's behaviour legally .
he was n't physically hurting your children -lrb- which is a lesser form of assaults -rrb- . thus there is more serious assaults getting into physical harm to .
you can certainly file the police reports .
i do n't know the law in your things , but here is quite likely that the police will go around with a man , and make it clear that if you can not decide to have a commitment to be described as it is accurate , you can decide to file the charges .
again , you are likely to notify the protection authority of the child , depending on what you live .
here they would be simply handed to the police , because it 's an extra influlial and decide that you do n't have exposed your child again to him .
yet you release a legal genie in a bottle which would lose control what genies do .
for instance , you and your son need formal state .
if you do n't want to act , then the police can act .
it might go to court .
personally , i would n't choose to do it that way , though you can certainly chat local police without name , and see such things like stern chat or have such a formal caution in your area .
i hope he is a big message , that you talk stern talks and friendship loss .
i am concerned about how he treatment his kid ...
that 's one hell overreaction .
if you had the evidence of his kid , i consider the notification that children would be protected to them .
ok your kids ?
that is scary .
did he have a nightmare or anything ?
i also chat the behavior over him ?
it did n't warrant such a reaction , but he did n't think .
if your friends behavior really not usual , i am worried about who is a bit too ,
i 'm 25 , and i have a relationship with a 37 - year married man for two years .
he had two kids as one kid from his marriage , and one kid in his previous relationship .
since our meeting , he had a plan to divorce .
things between us and i do n't know what to do !
he is planning to move out of the house by the end of the year , because he and his wife have not seen an eye .
he chat sex with a lady meeting on facebook with sweden .
it 'd affect me really bad when it found out .
i feel traitors , i still feel a traitor , not trust him .
how do i let go ?
you just walked away , jeje .
do you really think that you believe this is the best to do ?
if you really love married men , if it 's just going ahead for a divorce or have now moved out his house .
when a man had his relationship with you , the man involved his chat online ...
when you are messing a married man , you personally deserve to get what you get .
i pity you little or pity you .
but you can do you a good world just to walk away from him .
then why do n't you think you 're looking for someone unattached ?
my opinion is that your odd is a bit better to find happiness if you go that route .

on 080303 the highest eu court overturned a verdict of frozen the assets of multiple individuals and groups accused of funding terrorist organizations .
in 2001 the highest eu court overturned an decision by the european union government to freeze the assets of saudi businessman and assets based in sweden which suspected in funding al-qaida terror groups .
the rule would conflict the order of a united nations anti-terror order obliging member states to freeze the assets of people and entities suspected of funding terror groups .
the european union court also stated that the united nations order to order a blacklist of terror individuals or individuals in defense rights to review any legal laws under european law .
the european union court acknowledged the possibility of effect of the assets of yasin al-qadi and al-secondkaat international foundation .
unknown whether the european union nations will unfreeze a joint blacklist of joint terror lists .
the european union government argues that the court rules have not been obliged to remove the eu nations to remove the publications but only forced the european union to blacklist , to inform individuals and groups for an official blacklisted assets freeze .
the head of the saudi-based muwafaq foundation yasin al-qadi appealed to the european union 's decision to freeze proprietor assets .
us treasury official alleged the al-qaida front which is the muwafaq foundation , which was used to funneling millions of dollars and millions of euros -lrb- 11.6 million dollars -rrb- .
al-allekaat international appealed to the european union 's decision to freeze one million swedish krona .
a lawyer of al-allekaat international stated that money was used to fund money aid programs in somalia 's family .
thomas olsson stated that al-hatkaat international lawyer was now examining how to have an assets released to somalia from being using the network to send funds in somalia to his relatives .
thomas olsson also stated that the sanctions remain at united nations levels because al-hatkaat international had to examine the judicial consequences .
on 080303 the highest court stated to the european union on 08093 that the 27 nation was required to inform any frozen assets as part of the folbility of a freeze right to recourse .
a swedish lawyer who has represented al-hatkaat case was approved by swedish lawyer .
this rule could hinder international efforts to stop finance terror groups including al-qaida .
the rule overturned a european union court decision earlier in 050000 that rejected an appeal by al-qadi and al-alleat international foundation .
the ruling stated that the european union court judges lower judges legally stating that an eu court has no jurisdiction to review legality of the order to freeze assets from individuals and groups deemed by the united nations funding terror groups .
other suspects and groups that the european union terror blacklisted will also win legal list on similar reasons .
so far , the european union has no unfrozen the assets of these suspects and groups , not removed their name from the blacklist .
the european union high court has previously overturned its decision to freeze the assets of the people 's mujahadeen of iran .
at the blacklist of the european union terror organization , the exiled movement of the people 's mujahadeen of iran is an exiled movement .
hence , there is no informed why possible and group has been in breach of an assets freeze , because the european union high court overturned the decision to freeze the assets of rebel leaders from the philippines and assets of al-aqsa foundation 's based al-aqsa foundation 's assets .
370 people 's assets frozen due to the united nations security council 's blacklist of 370 terrorist people .
the european union blacklists also targeted about 60 organizations .
