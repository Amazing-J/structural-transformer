many times were sen@@ sed ur@@ gency at watching things many qui@@ et@@ ly . you 're a co@@ il dragon , a cro@@ uch ger , and i admi@@ re the patri@@ ot who is no@@ ble mind .
do history give us too many less@@ ons to us ? 5@@ 30 and 4@@ 64
looking .
the ordinary people are suffering from . the two sal@@ t fish , even if the sal@@ t fish turned over .
if people express somewhat different views with tra@@ di@@ t@@ /@@ thinking , or beyond slight different criticism in traditional views , they are called foreign sla@@ ves or accused of rever@@ e foreigners and fasci@@ nating foreigners .
they are considered more generous `` tra@@ i@@ tors of china '' as clo@@ a@@ ked in nationalism and patri@@ o@@ tism .
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china because it achieved the result of its consider@@ ation without fighting .
is the american so good ?
if your eyes does n't see what , and your ear@@ s are not heard of . three people create ti@@ ger , do n't assume they exist .
just passed by and look . i dont express my opinion .
comes to study and learning .
very attrac@@ tive .
it should be vi@@ gor@@ ously advo@@ cated .
some people do n't forget about chinese , if china needs me , i 'll be compe@@ lled by my sense of righ@@ te@@ ousness
i really hate those chinese dogs , especially those who eat the chinese things , especially saying that america is so whatever , but it 's going to eat and drink . if america is so good , find your father to be il@@ legitimate and drink .
i feel that our people should learn more from d@@ pr@@ k , and it needs to be held on its ban@@ ner , but it is impossible to forget what mao zedong 's thoughts .
the only thing mao zedong 's thoughts were able to save the nation .
too many tra@@ i@@ tors of china are tra@@ i@@ tors .
the patri@@ o@@ tism is a bottom line . everyone has to prove everyone de@@ serves the nation .
i think that does n't be that elite , but some corrupt officials .
remove this group of jer@@ k .
just looking .
we need 1,000 ants , because there are so many tra@@ i@@ tors in china 's history ,
due to the chaos in the east africa and north africa , we also have to prevent dog running col@@ lu@@ de with western imperialist africa .
everything has a set number of everything . there is no time to change in china . the weather changes . the tra@@ i@@ tors can only bar@@ k mad , like the dogs and nothing else , they can only be dis@@ appointed .
all direc@@ tions come to chinese court for not long before , the world should lead for this heaven .
following interest .
there is just modern china speciali@@ zed in this and we can do nothing .
too many of our compatriots are tra@@ i@@ tors .
freedom of speech is relatively relative ; we need to account for national conditions .
- free to speak / thinking : if people express somewhat different views and put slightly different criticism -lrb- who are somewhat different -rrb- or they are called foreign sla@@ ves or accused of rever@@ e foreigners and fasci@@ nating foreigners .
i would like to ask your dad that one of those above mentioned is fan@@ me@@ ly to say this .
for instance , although we are welcome to join the military affairs group the q@@ ors who would join the q@@ ors and f@@ ans@@ les for example , he must adhere to a system in group , and patri@@ otic , modi@@ fied by his business cards from other people , this group can only form ma@@ les to enter groups , so you will ask you to leave them volun@@ tar@@ ily if you conform to the q@@ ors , and you wo n't ally ally , and do n't follow your system as fasci@@ nation ; we are welcome fasci@@ nation 's equi@@ valent to the arma@@ nate the arma@@ ments with various reasons .
support , bu@@ mp
at critical mo@@ ments , we all descend from em@@ per@@ or yan and hu@@ ang .
look at the ku@@ o@@ min@@ tang cooperation with the communist that year , and you know .
in a peaceful year , creating a r@@ uc@@ k@@ us has not influ@@ enced everybody 's cooperation in war .
in a but@@ ton of ha@@ t , it can compete an article on the cultural revolution colle@@ cting problems to become questions about the principle or ide@@ o@@ logical lines .
the fif@@ th co@@ lu@@ mn has terri@@ fied of what is a good interest in the communist party ...
if you want to destroy people , the people 's national culture with to@@ ol is the first , if you want to destroy them up to the next grade , whether everyone goes to the next grade / everyone has to enter higher school .
turn .
you 're a co@@ iled dragon and a cro@@ uch ti@@ ger . it 's sen@@ sible . wait for opportunities .
in fact , the us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , because the current reason it has reached the result of current enemy soldiers without fighting force .
yes , many of the foreigners sla@@ ves . time we should reno@@ vation .
ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capi@@ tu@@ la@@ tors of china . den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing , who are not over@@ thrown down by the communist party , and if the fall of the us in the us , mr. huntsman will say that the communist party was not over@@ thrown down by the former chinese ambassador in the us , mr. huntsman will raise 8 million people in china and topple china , and the cia uses our so called `` domestic subsi@@ dy to help and let students allow the wind to make domestic wa@@ ves . '' *
reason to say i saw an expert suggestion for the last several days , and that i saw wang j@@ ing@@ wei dis@@ ci@@ ple as i g@@ li@@ se .
western society allows these people to see da@@ wn of democracy as fair and justice .
it is true that political development is too slow to avoid criticism of a bit advanced ideology . can we blame others ?
not to say someone is bri@@ bes ?
all the people are sel@@ fish and reality is also often gray .
all have become a joke view by z@@ f 's propaganda activities .
what 's wrong with them to criti@@ cise the previous stu@@ pe@@ fied propaganda in this environment ?
we could n't look over accountable for the old so-called japanese war .
look at north korea like our country many years ago . look at their ridiculous propaganda !
the united states will never stop a dream of occupation the whole world and is con@@ stantly planning a dream .
the kind of feelings more and more intense . this day , america has already suc@@ ce@@ up the fif@@ th co@@ lu@@ mn , by bri@@ bes the long intellectual elite .
these people can consider themselves a cultural cele@@ bri@@ ties , or can have high authorities and important posi@@ tions in various cir@@ cles in society , or take great pain to promote american values and brain@@ wash on chinese people .
why is this kind of feelings more and more inten@@ tion ?
i read the part of the speci@@ alist blog this day . i 'm not reading it , but it 's really surprised after n't reading .
professor for ren@@ min university , zhang ming , for example , is extremely obvious that many of his blog intend to be politically intended for .
for instance , he at@@ tribu@@ ted a cause of hostile preva@@ iling in china , and ele@@ mentary school te@@ x@@ t@@ books had wang er@@ ao , and he dis@@ par@@ age a good article of promoting patri@@ o@@ tism , with no value of both pen@@ ni@@ es .
another example : li y@@ in@@ he is called social sex@@ o@@ logist activist . she 's unlike her stuff -lrb- 1 -rrb- ; 1 . for instance , she is n't like trea@@ tary@@ te sex@@ ology report . second , she does n't think significant contributions .
the main reli@@ ance she rely on doing something different no@@ vel and the shock vie@@ w@@ point as she really ca n't rely on his eyes , whether she 's pure clo@@ wn .
this kind of people put on ha@@ ts of big speciali@@ sts for just to inti@@ mi@@ date him . the key is that it did n't understand politics , yet it was not yet to understand the shock concerning the shock and was over@@ ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance , but it was willing to sla@@ ve , but she felt fine , but she felt fine .
for example , the struggle between a bit less hosti@@ lity and har@@ mony in the title of a bit less hosti@@ lity and a bit more har@@ mony , she would completely gra@@ te class struggle and drive .
she at@@ tribu@@ ted a chinese society of money wor@@ ship in a title in which china has already become the most wor@@ ship of money ,
she is bla@@ ther - `` bla@@ ther '' to become terrorists in the title of whether you study paul or bill ?
she took a por@@ no@@ graphic no@@ vel from speech free , and she said that beijing is driving an anti-@@ por@@ no@@ graphy behavior in a title saying that a constitu@@ tional court should be established in a court to solve a por@@ no@@ graphic product problem .
she cri@@ ed several people , especially on the mas@@ ter@@ piece today , who dea@@ lt with beijing 's suspected in which to be involved in ero@@ tic business activities , and she gave details for the list of ero@@ tic products which was de@@ ep@@ ly intended to publici@@ zed public to other people , which is to make such a close amount of ob@@ scene good in jian@@ gh@@ e .
but it 's really pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous that this kind of jer@@ ky article actually put on the top .
the poet liu sha@@ he , a shi@@ chuan province , which is clearly engaged in contain@@ ing friendly cases by america as a eye s@@ well to contain it and the whole nation , had felt indi@@ gn@@ ant to the chinese people who conf@@ using sou@@ ps which were conf@@ using the poet will actually come out in their will .
for his tal@@ ents and what i always made himself to get famous from his remarks on the three countries , which i have always respe@@ cted by me , but i do n't expect to support a big chinese tra@@ i@@ tor mao yus@@ hi , as he said , some things he believes that the dis@@ respect of him , which makes me drop my gla@@ sses very much .
i also feel that the increasing se@@ gment of chinese intellectual elite eli@@ tes becoming tra@@ i@@ tors in china is ar@@ dent from a ru@@ mor whose notes shor@@ tly accep@@ ting the 100 chinese political contributions of ford foundation , and it has already become public@@ ly har@@ med , and what it has already been made public harm to china .
however , at these frequent remarks , i do n't understand why no one was cur@@ sing themselves , and moreover , at these suspects are able to continue high posi@@ tions where they call the wind and ro@@ use it in boo@@ t@@ sia and public opinion .
since there was an temporary fi@@ er@@ ci@@ on in the southern newspapers that were temporarily sett@@ led in short while ago , i feel like the intellectual elite part might sink with a media personality .
i remember the us just recently fought china more than 60 years ago , and it has still threatened to use nuclear weapons .
the us entered vietnam more than 40 years ago to contain china .
two years ago , i started im@@ posing sanctions to china again , and 've bomb@@ ed an chinese embassy 12 years ago , seized a co@@ lli@@ de in the south china sea , and re@@ starting 32 years ago , but i re@@ starting to contain china with a stronger fan@@ far@@ es over china .
i do n't understand why we are so forg@@ o@@ tten !
why are so many people who ignore his conscience , speaking on be@@ half of the us ?
people have no impro@@ vements in memory without the big lost . perhaps the greatest weak of us we could be in this .
therefore , the ramp@@ age of chinese tra@@ i@@ tors 's force is also standing to reason , and the fif@@ th co@@ lu@@ mn is run rampant .
are entirely possible ? we do n't raise the tra@@ i@@ tors of china , including the primary schools .
are entirely possible ? we do n't raise the tra@@ i@@ tors of china , including the primary schools .
just passed through and look ...
it passed through .
i would say what people say is quite a@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ing at mr. zh@@ eng@@ q@@ ing , -lrb- the f@@ rag@@ ment may be suspected by a so b@@ arely b@@ arely co@@ lu@@ mn . even if the f@@ rag@@ ment is the 5@@ th co@@ lu@@ mn , we should allow china to be different opinions , but it 's really different opinions , but the time is n't afraid of democracy or den@@ tali@@ sm p@@ an-@@ p@@ oc@@ ci@@ sm ! -rrb-
as what he says a@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ es at mr. zh@@ eng@@ q@@ ing , they may be suspected as the f@@ rag@@ ment . they 're not so b@@ arely there , even if they are the fif@@ th co@@ lu@@ mn .
we should allow different opinions to exist . really different times . do n't fear what it is . you said , when 5 will n't benefit china as democracy or p@@ an-@@ oc@@ ci@@ sm , but ...
japan has almost been an little survival born by dog fe@@ ces and us economy . they are preparing to start the war and pass on to others .
it is not so doc@@ tr@@ ine of the means , china is so .
if we value making peace with a wolf , we will pay pain prices .
are we various powers going to let us if we act a tur@@ tle ? the abo@@ time for cultural trou@@ pes and sport team , use funds for the defense front line ?
how can the great art nation accomplish ? if it looks at territory with bea@@ con fire everywhere up ?
time to wake up . there should be an amen@@ d@@ ment to thinking wrong and high level deci@@ sions .
for us , the wrong should put the wrong efforts to develop science and technology . if we left behind us , use limited military expenditure on the front line with soldiers ,
if we ow@@ ns the diaoyu islands to be mis@@ ter , please i would prove us by acting .

do we own the diaoyu islands ? as um , some say their own technology ow@@ nership is now said not being owned by some -lrb- a bit mess -rrb- and going to talk about development first ?
we do this once again . listen to carefully li@@ sten@@ ing to the diaoyu islands , who ow@@ ns ? who ow@@ ns ?
oh ? he 's own , or is he owned ? hur@@ ry it , say , and sh@@ ou@@ out `` a own '' and hur@@ ry and sh@@ out `` your own islands ' .

i ask that you are to own the diaoyu islands again , but i do n't sh@@ out lo@@ ud and discuss this matter gen@@ t@@ le@@ man .
oh , let me explain that the diaoyu islands will never exist a bit - this is a he@@ h@@ he@@ -@@ he@@ mis@@ understanding and mis@@ understanding .
it should have been called sen@@ ka@@ k@@ u islands , he@@ h@@ -@@ he@@ h islands and call it to be a island , so it seems like the diaoyu islands do not exist good problems anymore .
just call them to sen@@ ka@@ k@@ u islands . it is wis@@ ely che@@ er for a solution against ah , not a matter on the diaoyu island ,
its completely ending in the atmosphere of jo@@ y@@ ful , har@@ moni@@ ous peaceful jo@@ y@@ lity atmosphere .

that 's not a good thing - how can we speak without such tr@@ us@@ t@@ worthy because we are a big country which is responsible . the economic development is an over@@ ri@@ ding importance to let the matter and not mention the matter again .
why do n't you still leave ? get all out ok , do n't you go right ? call 110 -lrb- u@@ h -rrb- and have a move of pla@@ inc@@ lo@@ sequent police moving in ! disper@@ se you do n't seem to get real weapons , armed police , and steel army . pull a third arti@@ ll@@ ery troops .

the research@@ ers reported that a form of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s used to make k@@ ent cigaret@@ tes once made the percentage of cancer deaths has been caused by higher workers for as@@ be@@ sto@@ s more than 30 years ago .
the research@@ ers said the un@@ usual resi@@ li@@ ent of cro@@ ci@@ ec@@ -@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ ec@@ -@@ ber do@@ ec@@ ance at the cro@@ do@@ ung entry and that the ex@@ pos@@ ure of even a brief ex@@ pos@@ turing showed up in decades later .
lor@@ il@@ lar@@ d inc. at lo@@ e@@ ws corp. -lrb- new@@ -based k@@ ent corp. in new york -rrb- stopped a stop `` k@@ ent cigarette fil@@ tering '' in the fil@@ tering micro@@ ni@@ te product .
the latest result appeared in the new england journal of medical today which is a preli@@ minary report on more than a year ago , it appeared to be a preli@@ minary forum that br@@ ings new attention .
lor@@ il@@ lar@@ d spokeswoman said this was the old story .
we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s had any ques@@ tiona@@ ble property .
now not the as@@ be@@ one in our production .
lor@@ il@@ lar@@ d and research@@ ers have not been aware that k@@ ent cigaret@@ tes have been research@@ ed .
james a@@ . tal@@ co@@ tt , dan@@ far@@ ber cancer institute in bo@@ ston , said we have no information on what is useful danger to the users ?
tal@@ co@@ tt led a team of research@@ ers of the national cancer institute and har@@ v@@ ard university 's medical school and bo@@ ston university .
lor@@ il@@ lar@@ d spokeswoman said in 195@@ 6 that the very dest amount of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was used to make a paper early 19@@ 0s for fil@@ tering and was repla@@ cing different types as@@ sto@@ s .
the company said that 9@@ 8 million k@@ ent cigaret@@ tes were sold from 195@@ 3 to 195@@ 5 .
more than 3 million men expected to death among 33 men who work close sub@@ stances .
4 of the 5 survi@@ ves workers , among which have diag@@ no@@ sed cancer in a recent as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the research@@ ers say far more high than expe@@ cta@@ tions , the total of 18 people died in mali@@ gn@@ ant me@@ so@@ li@@ o@@ ma , l@@ ung cancer and be@@ sto@@ sis are dead .
tal@@ co@@ tt said that the death rate found was a strike struck on students who students related to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
he said that a percentage of those died in l@@ ung cancer , most of those working in the mas@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts factory in western gro@@ ton , are the most high of those stu@@ died in any indus@@ tri@@ ali@@ zed countries .
the plant owned by holl@@ ing@@ s@@ worth & vo@@ se co. has contrac@@ ted to make a cigarette fil@@ tering .
tal@@ co@@ tt said that the finding is probably supported by an argument that the u.s. should regulate one of the cro@@ do@@ ec@@ class as@@ sto@@ s more str@@ ing@@ ent than chr@@ y@@ sto@@ s found in most schools and other buildings ;
bro@@ o@@ ke t@@ . mo@@ ss@@ man , a few of the indus@@ tri@@ ali@@ zed nations with the university of ver@@ mon@@ t medical college and one of those at the university of ver@@ mon@@ t , said u.s. includes not having a higher standard of with@@ ering fi@@ d@@ les like dri@@ o@@ led as a ho@@ bi@@ dle .
mo@@ ss@@ man expla@@ ined that the more common cur@@ ly of chr@@ y@@ so@@ tile fi@@ ber is a easier reject fi@@ ber .
in july 2001 the environmental protection agency imposed a gradually ban on using virtually all as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
by 1997 , use of cancer as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is out@@ law@@ ed in almost all the remaining things .
in the 19@@ 0s about 1@@ 60 workers working in a fil@@ tering k@@ ent paper were ex@@ posed as an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in particular dus@@ ty the factory 's area using cro@@ ci@@ do@@ ec@@ ward .
in the use of more than a fil@@ tering process , the workers du@@ mped a large sac@@ k of impor@@ ted materials , a huge bin , po@@ ur bin , a co@@ t@@ ton fi@@ ber and ac@@ e@@ ta@@ tor fi@@ ber , and has mechani@@ cal mix .
workers describe a blu@@ e d@@ ust clo@@ ud of hanging over the factory as an ex@@ ha@@ ust fan ven@@ ti@@ lation the area .
dar@@ re@@ ll philli@@ ps , vice president of human resources for holl@@ ing@@ s@@ worth & vo@@ se , said no contracts for those workers and manag@@ ers were no contracts for the disease related to be@@ sto@@ s .
but you have to recognize that this happened 35 years ago .
it does n't bear it from our working force today .

ro@@ na@@ ld reagan claims that he won the cold war during the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the claim that the soviet union is over@@ exten@@ ding because it is attempting to keep up ra@@ y-@@ gun spending in ra@@ y-@@ gun has been shown carefully not true review .
then president pa@@ ppy bush claimed he won the cold war because of the collapse of the soviet union in the course .
neither to view that claim , capitalism will herald for many people , especially capitali@@ sts .
the purpose of a given partisan ha@@ iled natural glo@@ ba@@ lism as a partisan victory of partisan causes and a sense way to bring president to the people of the world 's alleged freedom .
capitali@@ sts who are always imp@@ ati@@ ent -lrb- for any res@@ tra@@ ints -rrb- used this victory to jus@@ tification that capitali@@ sts oppose any res@@ tra@@ ints or calling him back res@@ tra@@ ints .
but not everyone agreed to have that view the world and economic system .
as various moves of occupation , there is now obvious that capitalism , ex@@ pression of capitalism and capitalism in industrial democracy and going to invest in democratic capitali@@ sts , or obviously should be less obvious .
what do you think of capitalism and capitalism .
se@@ tan@@ ta said that the un@@ fe@@ t@@ tered capitalism yi@@ el@@ ded oli@@ g@@ archy .
the government regulations are good to evolve capitalism .
if horror , safety and environmental horror need to regulate , the industry will ever do what is right for humanity .
i said se@@ tan@@ ta was n't having a problem with capitalism but i have a problem with un@@ regu@@ lated capitalism .
this is completely my agreement .
capitalism will thri@@ ve capitalism by everyone under@@ stands the rule , playing by rule and enforcement the rule .
everyone really has to spend all times for trying to circum@@ vent rules , trying to understand the rules , or fight those who do not follow the rules .
that 's the problem with der@@ e@@ gu@@ late .
the rule will not be removed from businesses who have helped more competition , which means it has to be in order to bottom the new business starting from the bottom .
it was like the monopoly game rule changed on the half game so not all previous purcha@@ ses .
as some have told you , that does not benefit capitalism .
i only agree with ar@@ ab@@ s of all the examp@@ les seen .
that would be extremely ru@@ des but i can see in that humor .
those kind of co@@ stu@@ me should n't have a place in college .
but this kid listed co@@ stu@@ me in ge@@ ish@@ a and so@@ mb@@ r@@ ero and don@@ key , a few other co@@ stu@@ me who are n't sensitive to them .
is n't race sensitive ?
are n't they in mexico ?
that 's a huge part of dress when you get from cities to far more away .
how is that insul@@ ting ?
it does n't show someone who does something der@@ o@@ ga@@ tory , but it uses society 's clo@@ thing as a co@@ stu@@ me .
ge@@ ish@@ a was not sensitive too .
only this is taking it over the board way over the board .
sometimes people seem to be looking for reasons to offend .
so fran@@ k@@ ly it on the perspective .
someone always sees something and someone wants to think the worst to see .
that 's not changed by dre@@ ssing or no dress .
and why are n't that race only that culture spo@@ t@@ light sensitive ?
is n't it just equal to ru@@ de for we@@ aring n over@@ al@@ ls and sta@@ in sh@@ ir@@ t , black@@ en your te@@ e@@ th , and white hi@@ ll@@ lly ?
what about a woman we@@ aring the shor@@ ts , high he@@ els and made up too much ?
it must be stopped to drive at this in@@ sensitive finding of something forever .
and what they always find jus@@ tification if someone wants to look at why they are held back because they have whatever reasons on their head , no matter how they are .
but why would we really jump on that this super pc 's board ?
why is now the sma@@ lle@@ st offenses find and thrown out new discrimi@@ nation against it ?
and this rule appli@@ ed to 2 or 3 race ?
americans , white , black , green , blu@@ e , short people and tall f@@ at ...
what do you have ? when there comes to a co@@ stu@@ me and hal@@ lo@@ zai , would that make fun in some way ? but only three ra@@ ces getting on red light ?
is that not racist ?
students were idea@@ lism and temp@@ er of those at the time and cultural pa@@ tina them to realize that one should laugh and obse@@ ssed with one and his cul@@ tures - and that there is no evil co@@ stu@@ me of racism .
this absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean that it 's actually a ban on racism co@@ stu@@ me , otherwise you can all have a point .
i 'm up@@ tight about the p@@ light of the white people in the us , as anyone is up@@ tight to an up@@ p@@ light .
but anyone else read the article ?
no one b@@ ans on hal@@ lo@@ tman festival .
no one even talks with a ban on hal@@ lo@@ uke@@ me .
in fact , no one in this story wants other than the people who apparently want to ban what pos@@ ter , no one will ban anything .
these students have a simple goal .
if they are a@@ we@@ some , they say , `` we can change a few people , '' or `` we can make them think .
they do n't ban anything or not stop anybody from doing anything .
this story about students ex@@ press@@ ing free speech
they make the pos@@ ter ex@@ press@@ ing their opinions .
of course you want to wear a co@@ stu@@ me offence which other people find is happening , of course if free speech .
but also i 'm a free speech to complain your co@@ stu@@ me off@@ ers .
neither should be banned .
and that 's a way it works .
it 's not ir@@ relevant to involvement in your black face and no@@ audi@@ tings , or your co@@ stu@@ me in sand@@ wi@@ ch which i think was a little gri@@ ll onto .
freedom speech is free speech and the alleged ban is actually the opposite .
you all turn this story at the end of the story .
so , to say `` dear mas@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts '' , does she have any chance to de@@ thro@@ ne republican senator scot@@ t brown ?
why was it necessary to de@@ thro@@ ne against scot@@ t brown ? i kinda like him .
can eli@@ za@@ be@@ th war@@ re@@ n beat scot@@ t brown ?
i 'm not sure what one of them is looking around , but i 've ever seen , but it 's a lot of ki@@ cking , scra@@ tch and some ama@@ z@@ ingly pun@@ ches have to stay at home for almost a week , until the s@@ well she went down her eyes was up .
so yes i 'm saying .
i think democratic party gets one more senate seat .
it seems that it 's a lot easier task in mas@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts than the other senate .
i think its the best thing to keep a few republican who we have moderate for their right location ,
he may vote along a party line , but he is reasonable to come representing liberal constitu@@ ency representative .
not know , but it sounds like really con@@ test on be@@ ll@@ weather ?
it made a really great con@@ test for some off@@ -@@ year .
yes you care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
he beaten mar@@ tha coa@@ k@@ ley rather convinced :
he served a state senator for several years .
he even voted for several democratic party bills .
coa@@ k@@ ley is a bad candidate who runs terrible campaign . i hunt the great article around a year ago , which out@@ lined a tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous mistake of him .
the answer to brown 's policy question was difficult to co@@ gent .
i 've seen an answer several occa@@ sions that he does n't really understand the under@@ lying issue at all , including several real embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment answ@@ ers , really embar@@ ra@@ ssed .
until recently i really did n't activity or even care politics , and i 'd just look at what other people are in this .
well , although i just told you the person i vote would n't inform you much ?
what issues are important for you ?
obama because i thought he did good job for most areas , he let me down on some areas and i voted for a republican without way today .
i had a few times in the past .
anyone who do n't be a republican .
i think the majority of them will cause this country to become con@@ sti@@ pa@@ te to concern about the important everything .
they are willing to throw america under the bus to make obama look bad
ok . ebay has added a lot . you 're right .
i would vote for obama because i think people do a good job in difficult circumstances and can do much more than another term , and i worry about what any of them would be the no@@ min@@ ee presidential race to do as president does as president does .
i hear a good thing about some ron paul , but i do n't vote for just any people -lrb- especially republican -rrb- , that 's the only person i actually learn more democrat as rick perry .
imo , i am happy about ron paul 's race and especially deba@@ tes and debate .
i would like how he is against war and against bull@@ shit generally .
however , i absolutely do n't want to be president .
andre@@ w su@@ lli@@ van has a lot of post on him , where you are interested in more learning on you can start .
he 's un@@ endor@@ sed ron paul here , he endor@@ sed him and then thinking about the second .
i read a piece of fasci@@ nating in w@@ s@@ j today .
the author spea@@ ks how dis@@ mal low rate for obama 's approval .
he appears to have n't pul@@ led congress together to accomplish much , and the author only made it worse if he were elected a second term .
he li@@ ked obama bo@@ w@@ out second term and hillary clinton for president .
`` he believes , `` the best chance of bringing hillary together '' .
imo its a great idea and i think ideas but i do n't know what she feels about running .
she certainly has smar@@ ts and experience and is approved by a majority of citizens .
i think there 's a poor bunch of people on a republican side with the fence .
one of the bunch are not one of captured the ima@@ gi@@ americans ' nations .
imo ... to be a moderate and independent vo@@ ter who decide this election , they certainly do n't vote for any bi@@ ble books b@@ ang of life .
what do you think ?
should obama step down for its good ?
should hillary run ?
hillary 's time comes and time goes .
she does n't become friends in the democratic party if she divi@@ des the party and lost black voters .
no one voted for mr. obama does n't vote for her , and she voted for a whole lot less voters .
do n't worry , though .
she made sense enough so she did n't try to run for her sitting president .
the best case is scenario of re@@ election obama and obama continues to sli@@ de backwards even if the us senate people gained greater foo@@ th@@ older , and increased his collective mass in obama .
the worst case are george w. bush ii -lrb- and any republican candidate -rrb- who would n't mean huntsman , romney or ron paul .
so that means that a republican party will likely gain further as congre@@ ssi@@ onal ign and perhaps even further gain as its senate .
then the country sli@@ des right back in the dee@@ pe@@ st recession .
i suspect you are wrong with inc@@ lined to vote and the inc@@ line one you call bags of tea
i can actually think it 's wrong but i 'm wrong to turn out for moderate / independent voters too .
i expect to turn out fairly good opposition to that group obama .
i might accept hillary .
neither , the republican field have great imp@@ re@@ ssed me , like there was n't great imp@@ re@@ ssed by field .
the pre@@ su@@ med candidate in the democratic party are not crazy either .
but it seems that obama is likely to step aside even less as cain .
i guess i am not optimistic about the country 's future in the next five years , which is sum@@ mari@@ zed .
ny am ku@@ do@@ s for ny . they realize it is just a party line , but it is n't just a vote for the right vote for the right .
@@@ j@@ c@@ boy , does they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i got mixed messa@@ ges on ny times .
sure they will do sar@@ ste@@ p@@ an !
hopefully other states are aware that gay marriage has hurt nobody .
look at the mas@@ sa@@ ch@@ us@@ et@@ ts , they have it since 2004 .
do you hear that their society falling apart ? of course , not ?
i think it spread across the country as rapidly with ny states and then ca .
you ca n't stop this train !
@@@ j@@ c@@ boy , i hope congress will soon address this issue , and it just mo@@ ot into the whole state jour@@ ney of it by making the national law to marry the same sex .
you are correct , j@@ c@@ boy .
it is another matter that one 's home state recogni@@ zes the same sex people out states to marry .
i think that when i study the domestic relations law of ny 's is da@@ m@@ ned dignity that government may permit marry correct .
david said the citizens would create a da@@ m@@ ned government .
do you guys hear that the plane cra@@ shed into helicopters ?
i do n't have ideas on what happened to that thing .
what do you think ?
that 's a con@@ dig@@ fist air@@ way and air trafficker did n't aid to you under 1000 feet .
but these areas , the accident can need additional regu@@ lation , such that require minimum al@@ ti@@ tude to the tour@@ ist helicopters .
my husband and i spend one day out in the o@@ ce@@ an@@ side with another couple of friends and her kids ...
at some points we came across a huge fall tree , our friend l@@ . cli@@ mb@@ ed the tree and started wal@@ king up .
our 11 year-old son followed l@@ . but suddenly aware that people and people are not able to get down that easy .
he turned back to our son to ask her to get away and down to give him the room to get him too down .
our son stopped himself at once , but did not get out of his way .
he has fun and we have to tell him twice ... then obe@@ y .
after that , l@@ . get back down and grab our sons suddenly from , then thrown on the ground , with all their might and ye@@ ll off .
we are stu@@ pe@@ tive .
2@@ 38 years old man could easily inj@@ ury him .
fortunately he 's getting up , though he is very frigh@@ ten@@ ing .
we are never hit our children , so we will never de@@ ep@@ ly shock .
anybody know a legal way for teaching no money less@@ ons from men ?
was it not for fi@@ ling police reports ?
if someone is friends , i personally deal with the situation at a person level .
why can you not make sure you really upset , and do n't want to hit your kids again ?
2 of law re@@ me@@ dy
money damage and jail time .
i suppose you can add pro@@ b@@ ation but just repla@@ cing the pro@@ b@@ ation of jail time .
if you go on the legal route it 'll pretty much end a friendship , not matter what it is .
if i was angry enough to start this path down , i do n't worry about how it will end up .
i 've probably expressed feeling on the situation and i probably made it clear that it does n't have again .
assa@@ ul@@ ts your son
that 's the name of your ex 's behavi@@ our legally .
he was n't physi@@ cally hur@@ ting your children -lrb- which is a less@@ er form of assa@@ ul@@ ts -rrb- . thus there is more serious assa@@ ul@@ ts getting into physical harm to .
you can certainly file the police reports .
i do n't know the law in your things , but here is quite likely that the police will go around with a man , and make it clear that if you can not decide to have a commitment to be described as it is accurate , you can decide to file the charges .
again , you are likely to no@@ tify the protection authority of the child , depending on what you live .
here they would be simply han@@ ded to the police , because it 's an extra influ@@ li@@ al and decide that you do n't have ex@@ posed your child again to him .
yet you release a legal gen@@ ie in a bottle which would lose control what gen@@ ies do .
for instance , you and your son need formal state .
if you do n't want to act , then the police can act .
it might go to court .
personally , i would n't choose to do it that way , though you can certainly cha@@ t local police without name , and see such things like s@@ tern cha@@ t or have such a formal caution in your area .
i hope he is a big message , that you talk s@@ tern talks and friendship loss .
i am concerned about how he treatment his kid ...
that 's one hell over@@ reaction .
if you had the evidence of his kid , i consider the noti@@ fication that children would be protected to them .
ok your kids ?
that is scary .
did he have a night@@ m@@ are or anything ?
i also cha@@ t the behavior over him ?
it did n't warrant such a reaction , but he did n't think .
if your friends behavior really not usual , i am worried about who is a bit too ,
i 'm 25 , and i have a relationship with a 37 - year married man for two years .
he had two kids as one kid from his marriage , and one kid in his previous relationship .
since our meeting , he had a plan to div@@ or@@ ce .
things between us and i do n't know what to do !
he is planning to move out of the house by the end of the year , because he and his wife have not seen an eye .
he cha@@ t sex with a lady meeting on facebook with sweden .
it 'd affect me really bad when it found out .
i feel tra@@ i@@ tors , i still feel a tra@@ i@@ tor , not trust him .
how do i let go ?
you just wal@@ ked away , je@@ j@@ e .
do you really think that you believe this is the best to do ?
if you really love married men , if it 's just going ahead for a div@@ or@@ ce or have now moved out his house .
when a man had his relationship with you , the man involved his cha@@ t online ...
when you are me@@ ssing a married man , you personally deserve to get what you get .
i p@@ ity you little or p@@ ity you .
but you can do you a good world just to walk away from him .
then why do n't you think you 're looking for someone un@@ atta@@ ched ?
my opinion is that your odd is a bit better to find happ@@ iness if you go that route .

foreign ministry spokesman liu jian@@ chao said that the united states and other governments now informed a secret test at a diplomatic channel .
liu jian@@ chao stated that the technology has been used against satellite satellites , which is not meant to abandon china 's long-@@ standing opposition to military use of space .
in a brief ministry bri@@ ef@@ ing , liu jian@@ chao said the test did not target any country and pose no threat .
liu jian@@ chao said the china 's secre@@ tive military has not planned another such test .
a chinese test shot destroyed an over@@ age weather satellite called 5@@ 37 miles above earth and dete@@ cted a u.s. monitoring on january 11 , 2007 .
the chinese government ref@@ uses to discuss it .
the test rais@@ es concerns in the united states .
officials and analysts interpret it to a sign of the u.s. military satellites may be vulnerable to attack china .
it was added that china 's capability to shoot down a satellite could pose a hosti@@ lities over taiwan military reli@@ ant on satellites as the u.s. military has reli@@ ed na@@ is@@ s@@ ance , na@@ vi@@ gate , weapons gui@@ ded and anti-missile defense .
the new demonstra@@ tions could threaten taiwan satellite to monitor the deployment of medium@@ -range missiles and medium@@ -range missiles along taiwan strait .
the chinese test dis@@ su@@ med the ability officials because the united states and russia ab@@ sta@@ ined such a test after perfor@@ ming anti-missile technology in the 8@@ 80@@ s .

analysts believed a test on january 11 , 2007 as a moder@@ nization military program but china frequently declared wanting to prevent an arms race in space .
liu repeated the long-@@ standing position when asked if the contra@@ di@@ ctions appeared , and said china would further promote the de@@ weapo@@ nization and peaceful use of outer space .
china has consist@@ ently advo@@ cated a peaceful space development at the united nations and has push@@ ed international agreement to prevent china from becoming a theater for the new arms race .
the united states op@@ poses a suggestion to the international conference that pursu@@ es such accor@@ ds and has argu@@ ed that the conference would not be needed .
was being asked to violate an anti-@@ satellite test spi@@ ri@@ ts of the chinese pro@@ claimed position and is it because of you kept a sil@@ ence for nearly two weeks while officials around the world discussed on tests based on u.s. intelligence reports ?
