it begins and ends with romne@@ y@@ care .
if obama never pushed obaminationcare , then romney would be running away with the nomination !
funny he was considered the most conservative option in 2008 !
rush , levin , hannity , savage etc all said romney was the conservative candidate .
fast forward to 2012 and now he is the liberal candidate .
nothing change , except the passing of obaminationcare !
i think you draw the wrong interpretation of 2008 .
he was n't the most conservative , huckabee was .
and huckabee was sincere .
what you forget about all those talking heads is that they are all paid by big corporations .
